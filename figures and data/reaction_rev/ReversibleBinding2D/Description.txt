Reversible Binding 2D (JCP Figure 8)
This test case examines the reversible interaction between two, not necessarily identical, species. The 2D reversible binding test case assesses whether the simulation method depicts the proper kinetics and equilibrium for a reversible reaction in two-dimensions.
