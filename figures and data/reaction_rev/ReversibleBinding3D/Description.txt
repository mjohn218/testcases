Reversible Binding 3D (PRX Figure 11)
This test case examines the reversible interaction between two, not necessarily identical, species. The 3D reversible binding test case assesses whether the simulation method depicts the proper kinetics and equilibrium for a reversible reaction in three-dimensions.
