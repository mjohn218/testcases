Reversible Membrane Recruitment (Figure 9b)
This test case examines a volume molecule reversibly binding to a surface molecule. Slightly more complicated than the irreversible case, the reversible recruitment test case determines whether the dissociation reaction properly releases the volume molecule into the correct compartment. In addition, this test case assess whether the method uses the correct effective reaction rates between volume and surface molecules.
