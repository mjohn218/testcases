Irreversible Binding 3D (Figure 1a and 1b)
This test case examines the reaction between two identical species resulting in the destruction of both species. In particular, this test case examines whether the simulation correctly depicts the equilibrium and kinetics of irreversible binding for volume molecules. Two cases, one of them is absolute boundary condition (1,513.49 s-1.uM-1).
